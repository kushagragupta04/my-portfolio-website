      <p>Hey, I’m Kushagra Gupta, a Computer Science undergraduate at Manipal University Jaipur. I enjoy meeting new people, exploring different ideas, and learning something new from every interaction. I believe the best growth happens through curiosity and real conversations.</p>

{/* <p>For me, progress isn’t about big leaps—it’s about improving a little each day. Whether it’s picking up a new skill, figuring out a tough problem, or just realizing I was overthinking something the whole time, every step adds up.</p> */}

<p>I like working on things that feel meaningful, whether that’s building something from scratch, tweaking an idea to make it better, or just experimenting to see what works. But beyond that, I’m always up for a good conversation, an interesting fact, or a fresh perspective that makes me rethink how I see things.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I think life should be a mix of excitement and fulfillment—like unboxing a new gadget and finishing a great book. And when things get overwhelming, I remind myself:</p>

<p><b>Life’s just a big debugging session—messy, unpredictable, but always fixable.</b></p>
